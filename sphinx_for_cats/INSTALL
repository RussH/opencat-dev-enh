                   Sphinx for CATS Installation Procedure


    Preamble:
      NOTE: This document is not yet complete. Please visit the forums at
      http://www.catsone.com/ if additional help is needed.


    Index:
      A) Requirements
      B) Introduction
      C) New Installation - Windows
      D) New Installation - Unix/Linux


    A) Requirements

      * Linux, FreeBSD or Windows NT-based (2000, XP, Vista) Operating System
      * CATS (open source applicant tracking system) installed

    B) Introduction

        Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2.
        With CATS, Sphinx can dramatically improve the speed of database
        text searches (for example, candidate resume searches). This package
        includes the following:

        i)   A copy of Sphinx designed to work with CATS.

        ii)  A CATS module designed to take advantage of Sphinx.

        iii) An automated installer to setup Sphinx and CATS configuration
             files and install all other necessary files.

        This installer is a Bash script that will run under most UNIX-like
        operating systems as well as Cygwin, a Linux-like environment for
        Microsoft Windows.

    C) New Installation - Windows

        To install Sphinx for CATS using Microsoft Windows, you first need to
        dowload and install a program called Cygwin, which is a Linux-like
        environment. You can download the latest copy of Cygwin directly from
        their website @ http://www.cygwin.com/

        Installation Steps:

        1)  Download and install Cygwin. Run Cygwin.

        2)  Download "sphinx_for_cats.tar.gz" and extract it into your CATS
            directory. It is possible to use Cygwin to do this:

            cd /cygdrive/c/path/to/cats
            tar -zxvf /cygdrive/c/path/to/sphinx_for_cats.tar.gz
            cd sphinx_for_cats

        3)  Run the automated installer to complete the installation.

            ./install.sh

        The automated installer will install Sphinx, the CATS module, all
        configuration files and it will start the Sphinx searchd service.

        Once the automated installer has completed it will create a file
        called "install_service.com" inside your new Sphinx installation
        directory (it will tell you where that is).

        To install Sphinx as a service (this is necessary or Sphinx will
        not run after a computer restart) run this file as per the installer's
        instructions.

    D)  New Installation - Unix/Linux

        You will need shell access or a terminal on the Unix/Linux machine
        you are running CATS on to use the automated installer.

        Note: You should be logged on as a user with write access to the
        CATS folder. It is NOT SUGGESTED to be logged on as root.

        Installation Steps:

        1)  Download "sphinx_for_cats.tar.gz" and extract it into your
            CATS directory.

            cd /path/to/cats
            tar -zpxvf /path/to/sphinx_for_cats.tar.gz
            cd sphinx_for_cats

        2)  Allow the automated installer to execute and run the automated
            installer to complete the installation.

            chmod a+x install.sh
            ./install.sh

        The automated installer will install Sphinx, the CATS module, all
        configuration files and it will start the Sphinx searchd service.

        If you use an init.d compatible service the installer will attempt to
        install a startup script called "searchd". In most cases, this will
        be unsuccessful (as you shouldn't be logged on as root).

        If you have an init.d compatible system, follow these instructions
        to install Sphinx as a startup service after you have run the
        automated installer:

        1)  Log on as root

            su

        2)  Copy the "searchd" init script (created in the current directory)
            to /etc/rc.d/init.d (or wherever your init.d scripts go on your
            system)

            cp searchd /etc/rc.d/init.d

        3)  Run chkconfig to run Sphinx on startup.

            chkconfig --add searchd
